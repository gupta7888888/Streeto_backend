Great progress on the 12 models! Here’s a recommended next step order based on common backend development workflow:

1. **Validators**
   Start with validation logic (e.g., request body validation schemas) to ensure data integrity from the get-go. This reduces bugs early on and defines clear API expectations.

2. **Controllers**
   Build your controllers next. They implement the core business logic and interact with the models, so having solid validation before helps them stay clean and focused.

3. **Middleware**
   After controllers, work on middleware — authentication, authorization, error handling, logging, etc. Middleware plugs into routes and controllers to add reusable cross-cutting concerns.

4. **Routes**
   Finally, create and organize routes that tie everything together: define the HTTP endpoints, link them to validation, middleware, and controllers.

**Why this order?**

* Validators first = catch invalid data early
* Controllers second = core logic with validated input
* Middleware third = plug cross-cutting features cleanly
* Routes last = wiring everything into the app server
    
This approach also lets you iterate cleanly and test each layer independently.

Once you have this foundation, you can add other features like testing, documentation, and deployment.
