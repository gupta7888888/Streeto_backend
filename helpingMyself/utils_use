Got it! For a mid-range fast food app backend with your 12 models and typical flow, here’s a practical, well-organized **utils** folder structure and some key utility files/functions you’d likely want:

---

# Suggested `utils/` folder structure and key files

```
utils/
│
├── validationHelpers.js      # Common validation helpers for validators (e.g., ObjectId check, regex)
├── formatters.js             # Formatting utilities (dates, currency, strings)
├── codesGenerator.js         # Functions to generate codes (referral codes, order numbers)
├── authHelpers.js            # Password hashing, token generation, password validation
├── calculationHelpers.js     # Business logic helpers like discount calculation, loyalty points
├── notificationHelpers.js    # Wrappers to format and send notifications (email, push, SMS)
├── constants.js              # Enums and constant values (status codes, roles, payment methods)
├── geoHelpers.js             # Geolocation or distance calculation helpers
└── apiClients.js             # Wrappers for external APIs (payment gateway, maps, etc.)
```

# What each file does — high-level overview:

### `validationHelpers.js`

* Functions like `isValidObjectId(id)`, `isValidEmail(email)`, `isValidPhone(phone)`.
* Used by all validators to keep validation rules consistent.

### `formatters.js`

* Date/time formatting helpers (`formatDate`, `formatTime`).
* Currency formatting for prices.
* String sanitizers or case converters.

### `codesGenerator.js`

* Generates unique referral codes, order numbers, coupon codes.
* Makes sure codes are unique and fit your business logic.

### `authHelpers.js`

* Hashing passwords securely using bcrypt.
* Generating JWT tokens for authentication.
* Comparing hashed passwords.

### `calculationHelpers.js`

* Calculates order totals, including taxes, discounts, delivery fees.
* Calculates loyalty points earned from orders.
* Determines eligibility for promotions or combos.

### `notificationHelpers.js`

* Prepare notification payloads.
* Send emails via SMTP or services like SendGrid.
* Send push notifications or SMS.

### `constants.js`

* Central place for enums, e.g., order status, payment methods, user roles.
* Avoid magic strings spread across codebase.

### `geoHelpers.js`

* Calculate distance between coordinates.
* Validate delivery zones.
* Possibly integrate with map APIs.

### `apiClients.js`

* Encapsulate calls to payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
* Integrate with external services (e.g., SMS gateways, geolocation).

# Why this set for mid-range:

* Covers **validation consistency** across your 12 models.
* Supports **business logic calculations** reusable in controllers/services.
* Includes **auth and security** helpers, crucial for user login/registration.
* Supports **notifications and external integrations** for better UX.
* Keeps your codebase **organized and DRY** as it grows.
